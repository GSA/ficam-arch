![Federation Services - Overview of diagram follows in text below.]({{site.baseurl}}/img/services/FederationServices.png){:align="right" style="padding-left:30px"}

Federation is the technology, policies, standards, and processes that allow an agency to accept digital identities, attributes, and credentials managed by other agencies.

Federation has many different applications, including:

*Accepting an authentication transaction from another organization:*

> Agency A authenticates one of its users and passes identity attributes and transaction details to Agency B. Agency B grants access to an application for that identity.

*Accepting specific characteristics (i.e., attributes such as identifiers) describing an individual from another organization:*

> An individual can use their agency-issued credential containing an internal identifier(s) to directly log in to a different agency’s online service. The online service registers the identifier(s) in their system for future use.

## Federation Services
The Federation services in the Federal ICAM architecture include Policy Alignment, Authentication Broker, and Attribute Exchange.
