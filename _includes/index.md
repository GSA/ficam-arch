## Introduction
In 2015, members of the Federal ICAM Community participated in a Tiger Team under the direction and guidance of the Federal CIO Council’s ICAMSC to review, validate, and revise elements of the FICAM Architecture as described in the FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance v2.0. Members of this effort worked under the following guiding principles:

<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0px"> The initial architecture was still largely correct and relevant, and revision activities should focus on updates and enhancements rather than a complete overhaul</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0px">Existing architecture elements should be considered for update and inclusion to maintain “backwards compatibility” with existing agency architecture design</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0px">Architecture artifacts should focus on common ICAM goals, processes, requirements, and technologies rather than outliers or “one-off” agency use cases</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0px">Any new elements should address gaps or improve clarity without adding to the document’s length</li> 
<li style="margin-bottom: 0px">Updates should address the need for greater efficiencies, cost savings, and shared infrastructure</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 0px">Elements should align with the Common Approach to Federal Enterprise Architecture for government-wide consistency</li>
</ul>

The FICAM Architecture artifacts outlined on the following pages are the result of the Tiger Team’s efforts to provide the ICAM Community with a set of tools to review and comment on in order to develop a more complete FICAM Architecture.
