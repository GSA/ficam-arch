You can assign access entitlements to individuals, roles, and groups. These entitlements define an employee or contractor’s access to agency services, so you’ll need to assign entitlements before an employee or contractor can access an agency service.

In this use case, an administrator needs to assign entitlements to an employee or contractor.

## Examples

- I want to indicate that an employee or contractor requires and is allowed access to an agency service, so that they can access the service when needed.
- An employee is hired to be part of the financial review team and requires access to financial applications. The employee may have a specific role assigned to their enterprise identity record. 

## Next Steps

[Create and issue a credential](../credential), and [grant access to agency services](../grantaccess).
