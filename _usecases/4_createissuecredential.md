After you identity proof an individual, you’ll issue some proof of that individual’s claimed identity. A credential (like a physical card) is a type of authenticator that serves as a tool for an employee or contractor to gain access to agency services.

<p style="font-size: 3rem; font-weight: 700;">Use Case</p>

In this use case, an administrator needs to issue a credential to an employee or contractor.

**Note:** The preferred credential for employees and contractors is a PIV card. For cases where you cannot issue a PIV card, you must use a combination of factors to reach at least an AAL2 credential.

## Example

I want to issue an enterprise credential, unique to an employee or contractor, so that they are able to access federal buildings and protected resources to which they require access.

## Next Steps

[Assign access entitlements](../manageaccess) and [maintain the credential](../managecredential).
