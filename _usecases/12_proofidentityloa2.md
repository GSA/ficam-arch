**Pre-condition:** A need has been established for an individual to receive an LOA2 credential.

| ![1A. Identity Info Presented In-Person]({{site.baseurl}}/img/usecases/proofloa21a.png)  | If in person, the individual presents a valid government ID.  |
| ![1B. Identity Info Presented Remotely]({{site.baseurl}}/img/usecases/proofloa21b.png)  | If remote, the individual presents a utility company or financial account number and a government issued ID number.  |
| ![2. Information Verified]({{site.baseurl}}/img/usecases/proofloa22.png)  | If in person, the approval authority matches the photo on the ID with the individual.<br/> If remote, the approval authority verifies either the government ID number or the account number.  |
| ![3. Confirmation]({{site.baseurl}}/img/usecases/proofloa23.png)  | The approval authority confirms the individual’s contact information.  |

**Post-condition:** The individual’s identity is proofed at LOA2.
