#### Standards and Guidance

|  Title  |  Description  |
| -------------    |----|
|  [SP 800-53-4: Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  |  This document provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations and a process for selecting controls to protect organizational operations, assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats. |
|  [SP 800-63-3: Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  |  These technical guidelines supersede NIST SP 800-63-2. Agencies use these guidelines as part of the risk assessment and implementation of their digital service(s). These guidelines provide mitigations for an authentication error’s negative impacts by separating the individual elements of identity assurance into discrete, component parts. For non-federated systems, agencies will select two components, referred to as Identity Assurance Level (IAL) and Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL). For federated systems, agencies will select a third component, Federation Assurance Level (FAL). |
|  [SP 800-73-4: Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-73-4.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  |  This document specifies the PIV data model, command interface, client application programming interface (API), and references to transitional interface specifications.  |
|  [SP 800-76-2: Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-76-2.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  |  This document contains technical specifications for biometric data mandated in [FIPS]. These specifications reflect the design goals of interoperability and performance of the PIV card. This specification addresses image acquisition to support the background check, fingerprint template creation, retention, and authentication. The biometric data specification in this document is the mandatory format for biometric data carried in the PIV Data Model (Appendix A of SP 800-73-1). Biometric data used only outside the PIV Data Model is not within the scope of this standard.  |
|  [SP 800-79-2: Guidelines for the Accreditation of Personal Identity Verification Card Issuers](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-79-2.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  |  This document provides guidelines for accrediting the reliability of issuers of PIV cards that are established to collect, store, and disseminate personal identity credentials and issue smart cards, based on the standards published in response to HSPD-12.  |
|  [SP 800-87: Codes for Identification of Federal and Federally-Assisted Organizations](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-87r2.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  |  This document provides the organizational codes for federal agencies to establish the Federal Agency Smart Credential Number (FASC-N) that is required to be included in the FIPS 201 Card Holder Unique Identifier. SP 800-87 is a companion document to FIPS 201.  |
|  [SP 800-122: Guide for Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-122.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  |  The document assists federal agencies in protecting the confidentiality of a specific category of data commonly known as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This document provides practical, context-based guidance for identifying PII and determining what level of protection is appropriate for each instance of PII. The document also suggests safeguards that may offer appropriate levels of protection for PII and provides recommendations for developing response plans for breaches involving PII.  |
|  [SP 800-157: Guidelines for Derived PIV Credentials](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-157.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  | This document provides technical guidelines for the implementation of standards-based, secure, reliable, interoperable public key infrastructure (PKI) based identity credentials that are issued by federal departments and agencies to individuals who possess and prove control over a valid PIV Card.  |
|  [SP 800-162: Guide to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and Considerations](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-162.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  | This document provides federal agencies with a definition of attribute-based access control (ABAC). ABAC is a logical access control methodology where authorization to perform a set of operations is determined by evaluating attributes associated with the subject, object, requested operations, and, in some cases, environment conditions against policy, rules, or relationships that describe the allowable operations for a given set of attributes.   |
|  [FIPS 201-2: Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.201-2.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  |  This document specifies the architecture and technical requirements for a common identification standard for federal employees and contractors. The overall goal is to achieve appropriate security assurance for multiple applications by efficiently verifying the claimed identity of individuals seeking physical access to federally controlled government facilities and electronic access to government information systems.  |
|  [Technical Implementation Guidance Smart Card Enabled Physical Access Control Systems](https://www.idmanagement.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/1171/uploads/TIG_SCEPACS_v2.2_0.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  |  This guidance defines specifications and standards required to enable agencies to procure and implement hardware and software for PACS, such that these systems will: operate with the Federal Agency Smart Credential (FASC), such as NIST-standards-based PIV cards; facilitate cross-agency, federal enterprise interoperability; and allow existing legacy PACS to operate with FASC-compatible card readers until the time comes for its upgrade.  |
