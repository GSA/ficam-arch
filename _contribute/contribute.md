## Plain Language

Consider the audience when you submit content. Plain language benefits a broad audience. Review your proposed content for the use of acronyms and specialized jargon before submitting.

- Make each page brief.
- Use titles to help the user identify jump-off points for information.
- Write short paragraphs.
- Write in plain language and active voice as much as possible.
- Use numbered steps, bullet lists, and graphics.

The following are useful resources for plain language, writing, and style:
