Before you add a new page, see the list of existing issues. You can add a new issue to propose a topic, or comment on an existing issue. By creating or discussing an issue, you can clarify a problem, identify a solution, and propose a format for a new page. When youâ€™re ready, comment on the related issue that you want to write the new page.

To add a page and open a pull request, you must first [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank"}. We recommend that you [configure two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication){:target="_blank"} for your GitHub account.
