Issues are the primary method to share information and discussions with the broader community. You can submit issues with:

- *Suggestions* - you want to suggest a change or addition to the content on this site.
- *Corrections* - you identified a problem with content on this site and want to discuss a correction.

To submit an issue, you must first [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank"}. We recommend that you [configure two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication){:target="_blank"} for your GitHub account.

1. If you identify an issue while you're reading this guide, in the left navigation, click **Submit Issues Here**.

	GitHub opens, and the **Issues** tab appears. Review the existing issues to determine if someone else has already addressed your topic.
