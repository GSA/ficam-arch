# FICAM Architecture
This repository is for the collaborative development of the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management segment architecture. The repository contains Version 3.0, and a draft of Version 3.1, replacing the older (circa 2009-2011) FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance v2.0, Sections 1-4.

The FICAM Architecture focuses on the federal **enterprise** identity and access processes, practices, policies and information security disciplines.

_A federal enterprise identity is the unique representation of an employee, contractor, or enterprise user, which could be a mission or business partner, or even a device or technology managed by a Federal agency to achieve its mission and business goals._ [See OMB Memo 19-17](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/M-19-17.pdf).
