# FICAM Architecture
This repository is for the collaborative development of the Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management segment architecture.  The content is supporting the creation of Version 3.0 (and future revisions) of the FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guide v2.0, Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4:  http://www.idmanagement.gov/sites/default/files/documents/FICAM_Roadmap_and_Implementation_Guidance_v2%200_20111202_0.pdf

Additional repositories will be established soon for contributors to share implementation guides, code, reference implementations, and solutions encompassing Part B, Sections 6 through 13, of the FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guide.
